## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Client-Server Model**: Host creates game, others join via code
- **Android Native**: Built with Kotlin in Android Studio
- **Local Database**: SQLite for user accounts and question storage
- **P2P Networking**: Device-to-device communication for multiplayer

### Key Components
1. **Authentication System** (JWT secured)
2. **Game Service** (Manages rounds, scoring, and synchronization)
3. **Question Engine** (Random question selection and custom question handling)
4. **Player Management** (Profiles and statistics)
5. **Match System** (Active game state management using JSON)

## Game Mechanics

1. **Host creates** a game and selects questions
2. **Players join** and select their colors
3. **Each round**:
    - Question is displayed with 3 possible responses at triangle vertices
    - Players place their "Original" pin representing their answer
    - Players then predict 3 friends' answers by placing prediction pins
4. **Scoring**:
    - Points awarded based on prediction accuracy (closer pins = more points)
    - Score formula: `S = 100 * e^(-d/30)` where d is distance in dp
5. **Game ends** after set number of rounds, final scores displayed
